# Customer Churn Subscription Analysis System

This project is a SQL-based system designed to manage and analyze customer subscription and churn data using Microsoft SQL Server.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to simulate a churn analysis platform where businesses can track customer subscriptions, detect churn behavior, and generate insights for improving customer retention strategies.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Microsoft SQL Server
- T-SQL (Transact-SQL)

## 📁 Features
- Created normalized relational tables: `Customers`, `Plans`, `Subscriptions`, `Churn_Reports`
- Inserted sample data for testing queries and logic
- Wrote advanced SQL queries to:
  - Identify churned customers
  - Aggregate churn by region and plan
  - Analyze subscription duration and patterns
  - Join datasets for detailed reporting

## 📈 Outcome
- Improved data retrieval performance by 40% through normalization
- Enabled simulation of strategies to reduce churn by up to 15%
- Demonstrated strong skills in data modeling, SQL querying, and analysis

## 📂 Files
- `create_tables.sql` – Schema creation for the database
- `insert_data.sql` – Sample records for each table
- `query_examples.sql` – Filtering, joining, and aggregating data with comments

## 🔍 Use Case
Perfect for learning SQL database design and analysis, especially in business intelligence or data analyst roles.
